        <p> Who I currently am is not as exciting as who I wish I was or who I want to be. I'm an aspiring Web Developer, I want to know multiple languages besides English and Spanish, from Japanese to Portuguese.
            I want to have multiple Youtube Channels, and Influence people around the world to live their best lifes, I want to be a force of good in the world and those around me, there are so many things I want to be,
            and so who I currently am is nothing more than a person who aspires to be a bunch of different things. I am a learner, and will forever be one, I plan to live a life with no regrets, so I intend to give my 
            all in everything.
