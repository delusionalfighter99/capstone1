<h1>Hobbies</h1>
<p>My hobbies have been my life for a long time, only recently have I started to see other things as more important than them</p>
<ul>
    <li>I like consuming audio-visual content (Anime/Kdramas/Tv Shows/Movies)</li>
    <li>I'm aware this list should only contain current hobbies, but I want to learn the piano, so I will make that a hobbie.</li>
    <li>I enjoy walks around places I haven't been to before</li>
    <li>Enjoyed going out with friends, when I had them</li>
</ul>
